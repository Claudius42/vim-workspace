==============================================================================
1. Sensible Settings                               *sensible-settings*
This plugin comes with carefully selected settings that everybody can agree
with (i.e. syntax on, set ruler), are unobtrusive (i.e. foldmethod is set with
nofoldenable), or are hidden gems in Vim (i.e. recursive search with set
path+=**).

These settings are however disabled by default. To turn these settings on, add
the following to your vimrc:

`let g:workspace_sensible_settings = 1`

==============================================================================
2. Workspace Sessions                             *workspace-sessions*

This plugin will only maintain sessions that already exist, or if the plugin has
been toggled on. To do so, command `ToggleWorkspace` will create a session and
automatically persist your workspace until toggled off.
If you open Vim with a file as an argument, it will either direct you to that
file in your session, if it exists, or push it to a new tab in your session.
Cursor positions will also persist across session reloads.

For convenience, you can bind this command to a shortcut, for instance:
`nnoremap <leader>s :ToggleWorkspace<CR>`

If you would prefer that a session is automatically created if it doesn't exist,
you can add the following line to enable the behaviour:
`let g:workspace_autocreate =1`

The Vim session will be stored in your directory. The filename is set to the
default session name set by Vim, but can be changed with this configuration:
`let g:workspace_session_name = 'Session.vim'`

Over time, hidden buffers can build up to a point where most are unnecessary,
with only those currently tied to a tab window being important.
When called, the command `CloseHiddenBuffers` closes these hidden buffers.

==============================================================================
3. Autosave                                                 *autosave*
Files edited in a workspace session will autosave on InsertLeave, CursorHold,
FocusLost, FocusGained, and BufLeave. This will cover most autosave cases in an
unobtrusive manner.

FocusLost and FocusGained triggers will typically trigger only with GUI versions
of Vim. However, there are plugins that enables these for the console version
within Tmux (i.e. sjl/vitality.vim).

You can explicitly control this feature by setting the configuration to either 1
(enabled) or 0 (disabled), with the following setting:
`let g:workspace_autosave = 1`

CursorHold is dependant on Vim's updatetime, which is set to 4 seconds by
default. The sensible settings provided sets this to 1 second. However, if you
wolud like your own time configuration, customize the following in your vimrc:
`set updatetime=4000`

==============================================================================
4. Undo History                                         *undo-history*

When in a workspace, file undo history is persisted between sessions, without
needing to keep Vim on.

This feature can also be explicitly enabled or disabled, such as the following:
`let g:workspace_persist_undo_history = 1`

Undo history will be stored in the local directory as a hidden folder. The
default can be explicitly configured, and is set to the following:
`let g:workspace_undodir='.undodir'`

==============================================================================
5. Untrailing Spaces                               *untrailing-spaces*

By default, all trailing spaces will be removed upon autosave.
If you don't prefer this behaviour, add this line:
`let g:workspace_autosave_untrailspaces = 0`

==============================================================================
6. Omni Completion                                   *omni-completion*

Vim comes with omni completion since 7.2 (packaged with SyntaxComplete plugin).
Many filetypes also come with omni completion set (i.e. Python), but the default
omnifunc behaviour is clunky and substandard. Preview windows are set to appear
by default, and will close on InsertLeave (as opposed to sticking around).
Completion menu settings have also been tweaked to give more predictive
behaviour.
